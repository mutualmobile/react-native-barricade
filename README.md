## Usage/Examples

The three main functionalities are Barricade View, Enable Barricade amd Disable Barricade.

 
**1. Barricade View**

Adding Barricade View is the second step after enabling the mock server in index.ts file.
 Add the following code to app.ts file to enable the Barricade View.

```tsx
import { BarricadeView } from 'react-native-barricade';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
    // rest of the app code
      <BarricadeView /> // add Barricade view at the end so that it overlays the entire app.
    </Provider>
  );
};

```

**2. Enable Barricade**

 - You have to enable the Barricade View to add the barricade to the debug menu. You can do that in index.ts file.


```tsx
import { enableBarricade } from 'react-native-barricade';

const mockedApiRequestConfig = [] // add the config for all the apis that needs to be mocked
enableBarricade(mockedApiRequestConfig);

AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);

```
Create the config files for all the mocked apis. 
You can refer the examle app for generating the config files.
